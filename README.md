Database Development and Use

## Module 1
10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, we will be exploring why and how data is stored. We will also begin the task of determining how to decide how a database is organized (the schema), and what constitutes an entity (table) and what is meant by a relationship between entities. Lastly, you'll be setting up the repository you'll be needing for the course.
